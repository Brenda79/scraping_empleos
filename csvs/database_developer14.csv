Together we are building products and platforms that help schools thrive by making it easy for schools to share positive stories with their communities and the world.
About you and about the role
Apptegy is looking for senior Ruby developers with significant Rails experience to join a growing development team. We have a strong dev team with a full spectrum of expertise from junior to senior and need to add to our senior level ranks to help push the team forward. We are looking for experienced engineers who love helping and mentoring other developers and have the technical know-how to help us build the next generation of communication platforms for schools.
This is an exciting and unique opportunity for an experienced developer to work closely with a friendly group of engineers building technology that has a direct impact on school kids' lives.
About you:
You understand that no one is perfect, that we all have weak spots, and you want to master the skill of self-improvement.
You are driven to do amazing work and complete every task to the best of your ability.
You constantly push yourself to get more done in less time by attacking your work with intensity.
You ask for help when you need it, own up to your mistakes, and put the needs of your colleagues above your own ego.
About the role:
This position is located in our Monterrey, NL office.
Things you will do:
Looking after and enhancing existing production Rails services.
Participation in code reviews.
Helping us design the backends for new products, often from a blank canvas.
Deliver clean and stable Rails code (with tests!).
Be an advocate for tech and engineering inside the company.
Requirements:
4+ years developing and monitoring production Ruby/Rails apps
Top communication skills for both a technical and non-technical audience.
Able to develop idiomatic Rails applications to a high standard.
Solid REST API design and know-how.
Strong experience in a top-level database system (ideally Postgres, but others work also).
Desired Qualifications:
Awareness of current trends in DevOps and automation
Experience of front-end frameworks such as Vue, Angular or React (helpful, but not required).
Sound architectural skills for secure and highly available cloud apps.
Good understanding of Amazon Web Services (particularly EC2, EKS, Lambda etc.).
More about Apptegy
Apptegy’s mission is to help school leaders share the story of every student. Amazing moments are happening in school districts, but those moments rarely become stories that reach the community. Our products empower school leaders and educators to share those stories and run better schools.
Our unique value is with our publishing platform, Thrillshare, that allows schools to update all of their online communication from one place. Schools can write a message once, and Thrillshare automatically updates their iPhone app, Android app, website, Twitter, Facebook, text messages, and voice calls.
What it’s like to work at Apptegy
Working at Apptegy is… different. For many of our team members, working here is unlike anything they’ve experienced. We’re not going about building a company the easy way. Scaling a rapidly growing startup is difficult, but we wouldn’t have it any other way. If the challenge excites you as much as it does us, come learn more about what we're building and what it takes to be part of Apptegy: Thoughtfulness and High Performance.
Thoughtfulness
Internally, we look for chances to make each others’ days. Noticing someone needs a pick-me-up, remembering birthdays, and celebrating others’ success all help strengthen our internal bonds. Externally, we want to amaze people with how much we care about both the products we build and the services we provide — that happens by noticing and acting on opportunities to value others.
High Performance
What we are trying to accomplish is hard. While thoughtfulness is central to how we engage others, a personal ethic of high performance is needed across the company for us to succeed. High performance is a major focus in every role across the company.

Position Overview

Particle is expanding the engineering team into Guadalajara and hiring a Ruby Software Engineer! You will build, develop, and enhance the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) backend software system; which integrates with Particle's cellular partner backend systems and handles key aspects of the Particle cellular platform, manages cellular SIM cards, and cellular data reporting. As one of the first hires for the team in Guadalajara, this is an opportunity for you to get in at the ground level and pave the way for future engineers.

You will:

Develop backend Ruby applications.

You will use Ruby to develop and enhance our MVNO service platform built on Ruby on Rails (a unified internal API for other Particle applications to talk to cellular telephony partners to perform SIM activations/deactivations and to receive cellular data usage for every active SIM card used by a Particle cellular IoT device).
Add capabilities to those services based on product requirements developed by Particle's Product Management team.
Integrate features into the existing storage backends like MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis.
Test your code using unit and integration tests that run under continuous integration and validate your changes using real Particle cellular devices connected to the Particle cloud platform.

Ensure the performance, reliability and security of backend applications.

Perform validation testing of the resiliency of interactions with various telephony partners to ensure that even their APIs are unreliable, the requests are retried.
Add application metrics that will be reported to an InfluxDB time-series database and work with Site Reliability Engineers to add graphs and alerts using those metrics to monitor the health of the application and the telephony partner APIs.
Update dependencies to maintain the application up to date and you will collaborate with the security team to respond to security vulnerability reports.

Design the future of the Particle Cloud.

Collaborate with the Product team and lead engineers to provide users with a good experience at all stages of their journey deploying a cellular IoT product.
Plan your work for 2 week agile sprints with guidance from your manager.

Work daily with a global team.

Work with a global team of cloud engineers, embedded engineers and product managers.
Because the Particle engineering team is distributed, our team has excellent oral, written, and technical communication skills - something equally important for candidates to have in this role.
Participate in code reviews to learn about other parts of the Particle cloud, and share your knowledge with other engineers.

You have:

3+ years experience developing back-end applications using Ruby and Rails
A deep understanding of both modern web technologies (HTTP, REST APIs, web servers)
Experience working with asynchronous microservices, API servers, API gateways
Experience with Javascript and Node.JS
Hands-on experience with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Experience in test-driven development & knowledge of continuous integration and continuous deployment
A strong understanding of git and the GitHub platform
Phenomenal written and verbal communication skills
Experience working remotely for a globally distributed company

Additionally, you may have:

Experience integrating with cellular backend systems and knowledge of cellular concepts like ICCID, IMEI, IMSI, MCC and MNC codes
Previous experience with legacy web technologies used by our telco partners (e.g. SOAP APIs, XML)
Knowledge of how to build and deploy applications using Docker containers

Kinedu is on a mission to unleash early childhood development at scale by fostering quality learning experiences at home and at school and everywhere in between. The majority of a child’s brain develops in the formative years before he or she enters kindergarten, and yet the early childhood development ecosystem is highly unstructured globally with 66% of children under 2 at home, and 75% of children under 5 in a family care setting, which means unequal opportunity for babies to get the best possible start in life. Parents are busy and struggle to find and apply early childhood principles. Educators in early childhood, while being a fundamental resource for parents all over the world, are consistently in the lowest-paid professions across geographies. All in all, adults in every setting are resource and time-constrained and are expected to provide high-quality care without much support.


Kinedu seeks to change that by providing parents with an iOS and Android app that presents simple and engaging personalized video-based developmental activities for 0 to 4-year-old children. The Kinedu Skills® model allows families to understand how children are developing. Our catalog of over 2,000 video-based activities is focused on whole-child development and includes hundreds of articles and content focused on reducing uncertainty for parents during the first few years, all available in three languages - English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Kinedu reaches over 500,000 users monthly and has 6 millions emails in its database, its main markets being the United States, Brazil, and Latin America. Our solution ensures that children's learning has a timely start, and is guided by holistic, science-based guidelines.


Additionally, we have developed products to serve the leaders of center-based early childhood development (daycares, pre-Ks, etc), allowing them to reduce the administrative burden with a SaaS-based back-office product. We have an exciting pipeline of additional products and are at an exciting inflection point of growth.


As our Cloud Developer you will join our engineering team and lead various initiatives, while working as a team to work through technical challenges. Design, building, creating, analyzing and maintaining cloud architectures for marketing systems.
