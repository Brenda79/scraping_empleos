#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company, security company, a blockchain company, and a AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and we difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Ironhack is an education startup that was founded to disrupt the way tech education works!


Doesn’t it seem odd that we’ve been learning the same way since the Industrial Revolution? Virtually all industries are pushing the limits on how to do things faster, better, and more efficiently. Yet, for the most part, people feel stuck on a 4+ year (and usually quite expensive) path that often results in an unfulfilling career path.


We empower students to create a new path - one that leads to meaningful careers in software development, product design or data analytics in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education.


Our higher purpose is to transform the education space to be unapologetically outcomes-driven. Whether students are looking to change careers, get a promotion, skip University, or start their own company, we work tirelessly every day to make sure this path is as quick, immersive, and accessible as possible. Hearing these success stories is what gets us out of bed each day, excited to come to work :)


It’s with this mindset that we’ve become one of the key global players in bridging the digital skills gap, serving both those looking to get into tech, as well as the companies hungry for tech talent.

Projects

 

Partnership for Slavery-Free Supply Chains: Verité is currently working on a philanthropically-funded project to


create a labor broker risk screening tool that will enable companies to unravel complex labor supply chains and


identify risks of human trafficking and forced labor within them. The initial stage of the pilot focused on electronics


production in Southeast Asia and has since expanded into additional industries and geographic areas. Verité


continues to conduct original research on labor brokers and their practices in Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Egypt, Italy,


Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Qatar, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates


(UAE), and the United States of America (USA). This data is integrated with corporate supply chain data, analyzed,


and visualized on a data analytics platform to give an unprecedented look at the source of forced labor risk in these


sectors and regions. Intern tasks include:

and combat trafficking in global supply chains and meet the growing number of legal, regulatory, and market


demands for attention to severe exploitation in global supply chains. The website currently contains extensive


research on 11 key sectors and 43 commodities at risk for trafficking or trafficking-related activities, ten


comprehensive risk management tools, case studies, and links to guidance from other expert organizations. Intern

assurance)

 China Worker Well-being Project: This program is designed to change how workers are taught the key compliance


subjects (focusing on labor rights and health and safety) in China’s vocational schools, with a direct link to on-going


training and empowerment mechanisms in their post-school workplace life. Interns would work in cooperation with


the Grant Program Manager based in China, the China office Director, and other Verité staff. Intern tasks include:

Worker Empowerment (WE) Project: One of Verité’s goals is to empower workers to advocate for their own rights.


The worker empowerment program is a committee within Verité working to develop the organization’s position on


worker empowerment, freedom of association, and trade union rights. It seeks to build internal capacity and


expertise on worker empowerment through the development of a WE catalogue, business cases, and an impact

 Research & Data: The Research and Data intern will be responsible for maintaining the statistical content in the


Africa microsite on our website. The work will involve pulling in new numbers from publicly available published


datasets and manipulating them to generate updated charts. The project will also involve desk research to update

worker empowerment initiatives, and private sector engagements.

 Ghana Forced Labor Indicators Project (FLIP): Verité is currently implementing a U.S. Department of Labor-funded


project focused on growing government, private sector, trade union, and civil society capacity to combat forced


labor of adults and children through advancing the ILO forced labor indicators approach in Ghana. The Ghana Forced


Labor Indicators Project (FLIP) focuses on the gold, cocoa, and palm oil sectors and has three main objectives:
1. Develop a shared understanding of the precise nature of forced labor and trafficking in Ghana and how the


forced labor indicator approach can be utilized in support of this understanding;
2. Collaborate with stakeholders to support integrating the forced labor indicators approach into existing labor


monitoring efforts; and




3. Further capacitate the labor inspectorate and other key government actors in recognizing, documenting,
and addressing forced labor and labor trafficking and the risk factors and indicators it encompasses.


Ghana FLIP intern tasks may include:

labor in the garment sector in Argentina and Mauritius. The project will provide significant new information


regarding the nature and causes of forced labor within the garment and associated textile sectors of Mauritius and


Argentina; will build the capacity of national research institutions, government and civil society organizations to


undertake and use research to prevent, identify, and combat forced labor; will provide globally relevant examples


and assessment of tools for the investigation of forced labor; and will catalyze a broad group of stakeholders to act


on the research findings, making the link from data to policy. Verité is seeking two interns to aid with the rapid


appraisal phase of the project, with special focus on Argentina and Mauritius. Activities for this work may include:
