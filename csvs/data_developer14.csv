Position Overview

Particle is expanding the engineering team into Guadalajara and hiring a Ruby Software Engineer! You will build, develop, and enhance the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) backend software system; which integrates with Particle's cellular partner backend systems and handles key aspects of the Particle cellular platform, manages cellular SIM cards, and cellular data reporting. As one of the first hires for the team in Guadalajara, this is an opportunity for you to get in at the ground level and pave the way for future engineers.

You will:

Develop backend Ruby applications.

You will use Ruby to develop and enhance our MVNO service platform built on Ruby on Rails (a unified internal API for other Particle applications to talk to cellular telephony partners to perform SIM activations/deactivations and to receive cellular data usage for every active SIM card used by a Particle cellular IoT device).
Add capabilities to those services based on product requirements developed by Particle's Product Management team.
Integrate features into the existing storage backends like MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis.
Test your code using unit and integration tests that run under continuous integration and validate your changes using real Particle cellular devices connected to the Particle cloud platform.

Ensure the performance, reliability and security of backend applications.

Perform validation testing of the resiliency of interactions with various telephony partners to ensure that even their APIs are unreliable, the requests are retried.
Add application metrics that will be reported to an InfluxDB time-series database and work with Site Reliability Engineers to add graphs and alerts using those metrics to monitor the health of the application and the telephony partner APIs.
Update dependencies to maintain the application up to date and you will collaborate with the security team to respond to security vulnerability reports.

Design the future of the Particle Cloud.

Collaborate with the Product team and lead engineers to provide users with a good experience at all stages of their journey deploying a cellular IoT product.
Plan your work for 2 week agile sprints with guidance from your manager.

Work daily with a global team.

Work with a global team of cloud engineers, embedded engineers and product managers.
Because the Particle engineering team is distributed, our team has excellent oral, written, and technical communication skills - something equally important for candidates to have in this role.
Participate in code reviews to learn about other parts of the Particle cloud, and share your knowledge with other engineers.

You have:

3+ years experience developing back-end applications using Ruby and Rails
A deep understanding of both modern web technologies (HTTP, REST APIs, web servers)
Experience working with asynchronous microservices, API servers, API gateways
Experience with Javascript and Node.JS
Hands-on experience with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Experience in test-driven development & knowledge of continuous integration and continuous deployment
A strong understanding of git and the GitHub platform
Phenomenal written and verbal communication skills
Experience working remotely for a globally distributed company

Additionally, you may have:

Experience integrating with cellular backend systems and knowledge of cellular concepts like ICCID, IMEI, IMSI, MCC and MNC codes
Previous experience with legacy web technologies used by our telco partners (e.g. SOAP APIs, XML)
Knowledge of how to build and deploy applications using Docker containers
