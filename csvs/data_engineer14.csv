What’s it like to work at Stripe?



Stripe is helping the internet fulfil its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.



Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.



We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.



We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.



We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.



We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).



We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.



In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world."

Engineer



The LATAM team is a key component to Stripe’s global strategy in the Latin American market. Our mission is to reduce the barriers faced by large and emerging businesses around the world by abstracting away the complexities of payments. The Payment System Interfaces (PSI) team is responsible for the day-to-day health and stability of the financial infrastructure that moves funds into, around, and out of Stripe. Our work is critical to the entire lifecycle of money at Stripe. As we move money through payment networks (e.g. Visa, Boletto, Elo, OXXO), we have to ensure we correctly collect the funds, pay them out to our users, account for all of this movement, and keep an eye on everything in between.



This function will sit at the intersection of engineers and LATAM financial partners, connecting them to ensure that everyone thrives and nothing is lost in translation. We partner closely with our Payment Infrastructure engineering teams to deeply understand and tackle the technical and real-world challenges of Stripe’s payments stack.



On Technical Operations you may:

Become a domain expert in an area of Stripe’s payments stack

Handle inquiries from internal Stripes and external partners’ technical teams, often requiring detailed investigation and sometimes code changes

Engage with Stripe’s financial partners to drive alignment on product usage, troubleshoot and solve technical problems or breakages

Organize and direct complex technical changes and projects between Stripe and our partners

Identify and automate inefficient or unnecessary manual processes through code changes, partner agreements, or making and coordinating more complex code changes across Stripe

Design future anomaly detection systems and tools to ensure that data flowing through our partner and internal systems is reliable and correct

Collaborate across the company, including engineering, accounting, financial partnerships and product, to trace and account for billions of dollars moving through the Stripe platform



Technical Operations roles are one part coding and one part managing projects. The ideal candidate will have experience in both, but successful candidates may index more highly in one or the other. We work mostly in Ruby and Java. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general coding skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.



The ideal candidate possesses many of the following:

Knowledge of and experience with payment technologies and ecosystems

Have fluency and strong communication skills in either Spanish or Portuguese

Comfort using SQL to navigate Stripe’s data and diagnose the scope and urgency of issues

Comfort with developer tools (e.g. git), and an ability to make well-scoped code changes in Stripe’s codebase

Great technical problem-solving skills, with an ability to develop a working understanding of a technical system using a variety of methods. These include (but aren’t limited to): reading/writing code, reading documentation or partner specifications, running debugging programs, reading logs, asking well-formed questions to domain experts, or digging into the raw data through various interfaces.

Great communication skills, with an ability to frame messages appropriately for technical and non-technical audiences

The will to deliver results, with an ability to establish priorities and reliably execute on solutions (often with hard external deadlines)

An instinct to produce work that increases the impact of others, and helps us scale and grow (e.g. documentation, tools)"

What’s it like to work at Stripe?



Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.



Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.



We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.



We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.



We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.



We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).



We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.



In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world."

Engineer



Build the core of Stripe products, services and APIs in spectacularly robust fashion.



The LATAM team is a key component to Stripe’s global strategy in the Latin American market. Our mission is to reduce the barriers faced by large and emerging businesses around the world by abstracting away the complexities of payments. The LATAM team is responsible for building the payments products & infrastructure needed to launch new markets and process payments successfully throughout Latin America.



As a global platform company, Stripe processes payments, runs marketplaces, detects fraud, and helps entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world. Our success depends on building the best payments system possible for our merchants, when our merchants succeed we succeed. As a backend engineer on the team, you will build and expand Products, APIs and services while working with our partners to launch new markets and capabilities.



You will:

Be responsible for integrating, extending, and expanding Stripe’s products and services to support merchants and their customers in Latin America.

Help define and measure the quality of our products in the region.

Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams.

Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack.

Work with engineers across the company to build new Stripe features.

Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes across the company.



You may be fit for this role if you:

Have 7+ years of backend engineering experience building or supporting online products.

Love to design systems that are elegant abstractions over complex financial industry patterns/practices.

Believe that the mission of building financial infrastructure for Latin America is worth pursuing, and are motivated by reducing the complexity of the existing landscape.

Have fluency and strong communication skills in either Spanish or Portuguese.

Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Java. - However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than - knowledge of a particular language or framework.

Are comfortable with goals that are ambiguous, and can help drive them towards clarity.

Are excited as much by the impact you create as you are by how you achieve it.

Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems.

Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.

Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject-matter experts.

Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers; from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers, to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.



It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.



You might work on:

Building a new API for our users, or iterate on existing APIs.

Launching a new market, payment method, or product.

Building automated systems to ensure Stripe is meeting the legal and regulatory obligations in all the countries we operate inside of.

Working with our Analytics and Fraud teams to reduce chargebacks and declines.

Building new tools for our business teams.

What’s it like to work at Stripe?



Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.



Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.



We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.



We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.



We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.



We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).



We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.



In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world."

Position: Database Engineer

Reports to: Software Team Lead / Senior Database Engineer

Location: Mexico City, Mexico

Experience: 1 – 6 years database programming experience



ABOUT US


Paga is solving the “use of cash” problem in emerging markets. Over 2 billion people find it difficult to transfer or leverage money for basic human needs. This leads to the use of cash across most of the world with 90% of transactions in emerging markets performed using cash. Our focus is to digitize cash by building an ecosystem that enables people to digitally send and receive money and delivers inclusive financial services. In all our markets, we take a partnership model in working with local banks and financial institutions.


Our purpose is to make it simple for one billion people to access and use money.


Our strategic intent is to scale an emerging markets payments powerhouse by focusing on large countries where the problems we seek to solve exist. Our first market has been Nigeria where we are the leading mobile money operator. Currently in Nigeria, Paga has a market of 200m people, 53% of whom are under the age of 33. In this, the largest economy in Africa at $405bn, only 36% of adults are banked. The statistics show, however, that 60m people are unbanked while 70m are online – suggesting that the mobile money/mobile fintech environment is poised for exponential growth.


Paga offers a consumer mobile wallet that works on any type of phone – smartphones and feature phones – and any internet enabled device. The Paga wallet is similar to PayPal/Venmo/Alipay - the consumer can link her/his bank accounts or cards or save cash in the wallet. Consumers can then use Paga for a variety of use cases – P2P money transfers, bill payments, paying merchants online or in-store etc. Customers can also access financial services from partner banks and financial institutions on Paga.


Paga reaches the mass market via a network of microbusinesses and SMEs (moms and pops), agents. The agents are independent retailers who offer Paga services in their local communities.


Paga has been recognized locally and globally and has won or been nominated for a variety of mobile money, payment operator, entrepreneurial and related awards. Most notably selected two years in a row for CB Insights Fintech 250, and Paga’s Founder and Group CEO has been identified as one of the 100 most influential people in Africa.


KEY PAGA FACTS



16m unique users
26k agents across Nigeria
3.5m transactions per month
US$200m transaction value per month
520 staff
97% 5-year CAGR on transaction values
Paga is PCIDSS Level 1 certified
Notable investors include Acumen Fund, Omidyar Network, Adlevo Capital, Capricorn Investment Group, Goodwell, Global Innovation Fund, Tim Draper, Lord Jim O'Neill (Former Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs who coined the “BRIC” term).



CULTURE AND VALUES


Paga has a ""down to earth"" environment – we are not a hierarchical company. We believe strongly in the African proverb that says, “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.” Everyone in the company is encouraged to voice their opinions, to challenge any idea with the aim to improve upon it.


As such, we are very focused on Collaboration as a core value. It is together we will achieve our purpose.


Everyone is encouraged to take Ownership – no passing of the buck, no waiting for your boss to tell you what to do, no micromanaging. We want people to act boldly and if they fail it is fine.


We learn and move forward. Our team is laser focused on achieving Results and challenging ourselves to go for more.


Innovation is at the core of our company. We do not believe there is any system that cannot be improved. We seek to solve problems by engaging with our customers who we seek to serve and try to have empathy to see the world from their point of view.


In our business it is vital we hold ourselves to the highest level of Integrity. We see integrity as a zero-sum game and do not take lightly the trust our customers place in us.


LAUNCHING PAGA MEXICO


We are launching our business in Mexico because we see a unique opportunity to leverage our platform and 10+ years’ experience in Nigeria to digitize cash in Mexico and deliver financial services to the mass market.


Mexico is the 15th largest economy in the world and Latin America’s 2nd largest economy. Yet, cash payments represent 82% of consumer transactions in 2018.


There is a significant opportunity to offer digital payments to solve the cash problem in Mexico. Paga is uniquely placed to solve this problem because of our expertise in digitizing mass market; our robust and scalable platform that is already built and is multicurrency, multilingual, and holds any type of account; and we already have a wide array of offerings we can bring to bear in Mexico.

Paga is now building its team in Mexico.


We are starting by building a core team that will lead the establishment of Paga Mexico with the support of their other Paga global counterparts.
